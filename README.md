## About the Project

This project is a simple **travel recommendation app** that helps users pick the perfect trip based on their preferences. Users answer three questions about location, activity, and budget, and the app gives a travel suggestion. It was built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

### Key Features:
- **Choose Location**: Mountains or Beach.
- **Pick an Activity**: Adventure or Relaxation.
- **Set Your Budget**: Low, Medium, or High.
- **Get Recommendations**: Personalized trip suggestions based on your choices.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Modern UI**: Clean, attractive design with a 3D look.

## How to Use It

1. **Clone the repository:**

   bash
   git clone https://github.com/naganihita/interactive-travel-planner.git
   

2. **Open the folder:**

   bash
   cd interactive-travel-planner
   

3. **Open the app in your browser:**
   Just double-click the `index.html` file, or right-click and choose "Open with browser."

4. **Start Planning:**
   - Choose your preferences for **location** (beach or mountains), **activity** (adventure or relaxation), and **budget**.
   - Click **Get Recommendation** to see your personalized travel suggestion!

### Example:
- Beach + Adventure + Low Budget → "Try Costa Rica for an affordable beach adventure! Enjoy surfing, ziplining, and exploring rainforests."

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for the structure of the page.

## Ideas for Improvement

- Add more travel suggestions for different types of trips.
- Let users enter specific preferences like exact budget amounts.
- Add an option to save or share the trip suggestions.
- Use real-time travel data from APIs like Google Places or TripAdvisor.
